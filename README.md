Battleship game for demo purposes

Basic functional Battleship game where the user aims to strike enemy ships on a 10x10 board. Initially, this began as a
project assignment from Codeacademy, which featured a single enemy ship as a single point in a 5x5 grid. Since then, 
this has been expanded and built upon to include: 

* Five enemy ships of different sizes, which are randomly generated upon each new game.
* A score system is in place that counts the user's hits, misses, enemy ships sunk and winning of the game.
* The game plays over 30 turns. After 30 turns the game automatically ends, at which point the user can type in their name, which will save this 
along with the score and date of play into a separate .csv file. This will then display in the game and the user will be given an option for rematch.
* Dynamic code that can function with a bigger board and many more ships. 



Have fun and do let me know if you come across any bugs!
